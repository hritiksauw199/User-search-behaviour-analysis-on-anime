# User-search-behaviour-analysis-on-anime

In the course of this project, we examined anime-related search queries originating from diverse users, taking into account their distinctive search patterns, visited websites, geographic trends, and other relevant factors. Our primary objective was to discern the factors influencing these searches and to observe how these influences evolved over time. Despite the inherent limitation of our dataset, we managed to extract valuable insights within a condensed timeframe. To refine our understanding, we narrowed our focus exclusively to the United States.

For this project we utilized Exasol to establish a connection with the database image (Installation and setup guide below). Employing SQL queries, we mined the data for answers and leveraged Python for data cleaning purposes. Furthermore, our utilization of Python extended to interfacing with external data sources, allowing us to extract nuanced insights and formulate substantiated conclusions. This comprehensive approach, combining database querying and programming, enabled us to derive a comprehensive understanding of anime-related search behaviors, especially within the context of the U.S. region.

# About the Data

Presented here is a snapshot encompassing over 36 million query logs, predominantly originating from U.S. citizens, and the corresponding clicked results spanning the period from March to June 2006. This dataset was culled from the AOL search engine during a period when Google search technology was in use.
